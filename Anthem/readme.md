In this room, you don't need to brute force any login page. Just your preferred browser and Remote Desktop.

# A cheers to our IT department

Tuesday, December 31, 2019

During our hard times our beloved admin managed to save our business by
redesigning the entire website.

As we all around here knows how much I love writing poems I decided to write
one about him:

Born on a Monday,  
Christened on Tuesday,  
Married on Wednesday,  
Took ill on Thursday,  
Grew worse on Friday,  
Died on Saturday,  
Buried on Sunday.  
That was the endâ€¦

# [Task 2] Spot the flags

Our beloved admin left some flags behind that we require to gather before we proceed to the next task..

## #1 - What is flag 1?

The flag appears in the meta content of the "we-are-hiring" page:

~~~
$ curl -s http://10.10.29.47/archive/we-are-hiring/ | grep THM
<meta content="THM{L0L_WH0_US3S_M3T4}" property="og:description" />
        <input type="text" name="term" placeholder="Search... 								THM{G!T_G00D}" />
~~~

Flag1: `THM{L0L_WH0_US3S_M3T4}`

## #2 - What is flag 2?

*Hint: Search for it*

The flag appears in the source code of the main page:

~~~
 curl -s http://10.10.29.47/ | grep THM
        <input type="text" name="term" placeholder="Search... 								THM{G!T_G00D}" />
~~~

        <input type="text" name="term" placeholder="Search... 								THM{G!T_G00D}" />
~~~

Flag4: `THM{AN0TH3R_M3TA}`

# [Task 3] Final stage

Let's get into the box using the intel we gathered.

## #1 - Let's figure out the username and password to log in to the box.(The box is not on a domain)

You can connect to http://10.10.29.47/umbraco/ using the information found previously:
* username: SG@anthem.com
* password: UmbracoIsTheBest!

## #2 - Gain initial access to the machine, what is the contents of user.txt?

Now, let's try to connect via RDP with:
* username: SG
* password: UmbracoIsTheBest!

!["user-flag.png"](files/user-flag.png)

User flag: `THM{N00T_NO0T}`

## #3 - Can we spot the admin password?

*Hint: It is hidden.*

There is a hidden `backup` directory on the `C:\` drive, that contains a file named `restor.txt`. Give it permissions:

!["permissions.png"](files/permissions.png)

C:\>dir /a:hd
 Volume in drive C has no label.
